## IMPORTANT <a name="important"></a>
All of the details regarding the work for this project are present in this repository's Jupyter notebook. 




## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This application uses a CNN to predict dog breeds from images. 
A comprehensive overview and description of the project motivations, as well as the algorithms and work that went into creating the CNN, are all present in this repository's jupyter notebook/pdf files. In them, I go into a detailed analysis and walkthrough of the build process for the CNN from quantitative and qualitative perspectives. 

When using the app, keep the image size below 1MB for optimum performance!
