## IMPORTANT <a name="important"></a>
All of the details regarding the work for this project are present in this repository's Jupyter notebook. 




## Project Overview <a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of this project was to define and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that could predict dog breeds from images of dogs. 
The project motivation and problem statement are (from Udacity):
```
Why We're Here
You will make the first steps towards developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app. At the end of this project, your code will accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. The image below displays potential sample output of your finished project (... but we expect that each student's algorithm will behave differently!).
```




When using the app, keep the image size below 1MB for optimum performance!



## Installation and Run <a name="installation"></a>
The app uses the following non-standard packages: To see a list of all of the packages required to run the app, please look at the requirements.txt file in `app_heroku`.

#### Run:
##### To view the app in Heroku: https://dogdash.herokuapp.com

##### To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. `cd app_heroku`
2. `pip install --user virtualenv`
3. `virtualenv env`
4. `source venv/bin/activate`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `python app.py`



When using the app, keep the image size below 1MB for optimum performance!
