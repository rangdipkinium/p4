## Project Motivation
This application uses a CNN to predict dog breeds from images. 
A comprehensive overview and description of the project motivations, as well as the algorithms and work that went into creating the CNN, are all present in this repository's jupyter notebook/pdf files. In them, I go into a detailed analysis and walkthrough of the build process for the CNN from quantitative and qualitative perspectives.
